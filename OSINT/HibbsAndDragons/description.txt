Problem Name: HibbsAndDragons
Problem Category: OSINT
Problem Description: 


Out of all d100 stores around San Antonio, there is only one place Dr. Hibbs likes to go for his D&D sessions. I want to find out 
where he goes so I can ask him to help me with my homework in between combat rounds.

He has hinted that the place was that there has good drinks and great performances (whatever the hell that means).
He also said that since the Dungeon Master is continuously late, thankfully his group is able to play lots of games while they wait.
Please put the name of the store in the following format: TUCTF1{Store_Name} for example: TUCTF1{Tycoon_Flats}

4th Wall Break: I have no idea if Dr. Hibbs has ever been here, I'm just making all this up for the ctf :)
