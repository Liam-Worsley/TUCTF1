# TUCTF1

This is technically the first Trinity University CTF!!!
Gonna be really scuffed so bear with me. A decent amount of challenge categories will be missing, if people like this one I will try to make another with more stuff. Winner gets a mystery gift (TBD).

RULES
1. No attacking the infrasturcure (Me IRL, my email, GitHub, or other). I will find you, but if I don't ITS will so play nice :)
2. Submit all solutions to lworsley@trinity.edu, you must submit ALL solutions in the following format (no only doing half the problems), you can just copy paste:
   Name: {YOUR NAME HERE}
   MansBestFriend: {SOLUTION HERE}
   OfficeHoursAreForRSA: {SOLUTION HERE}
   CanThisCountAsMyGameDevClass: {SOLUTION HERE}
   LongCovid: {SOLUTION HERE}
   ZhangAISong: {SOLUTION HERE}
   HibbsAndDragons: {SOLUTION HERE}
   ScalaSkaters: {SOLUTION HERE}
4. All solutions should be submitted in the format TUCTF1{something_will_be_in_here}. 
5. Please wait until you get a reply from me before you submit again, I will only tell you if you got all of them right or wrong. Please be patiend, I have no idea how many of y'all will do this so I may get overwhelmed. Most of the answers will be pretty noticeable if you get them.
6. After someone finishes the competition, I will announce it to the CS Major's List so please don't email me afterwards instead hunt me down in person, I'm usually in CSI 270A.
7. NO BRUTE FORCING - looking at you Chase <3
8. ChatGPT, AI, and your local professors are at your disposal, go annoy them instead of me.
9. If you notice any errors, bugs, or anything else concering please let me know. Reports of bugs will receive a crisp high five.
10. Have fun! But not too much fun its finals season :)
