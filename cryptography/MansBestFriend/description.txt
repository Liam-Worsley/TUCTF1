Problem Description: 

Have you seen Dr. Tan's robotic dog in his office? It's sooo cute!!!
But is it called robotic dog? robot dog? robodog? rdog?
I'm not too sure but all I know is you have to DRAG me away from it.
Anyways enough hints here's not one but 2 ciphertexts, one for you and one for the dog, I encoded them both:
